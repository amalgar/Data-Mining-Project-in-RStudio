Many of the early signs of kidney failure can be confused with other illnesses and conditions. This makes diagnosis difficult ! Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse.

This Chronic Kidney Disease dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. itâ€™s collected over a period of 2 months. It contains measures of 23 features for 157 hospital patients. We have 12 numerical variables and 9 nominal variables. We have processed some data cleaning with excel to get this final result ; we removed missing values, changed column names to appear more clear and kept the most significant variables.
